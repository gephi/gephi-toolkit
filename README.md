# Gephi Toolkit - All Gephi in one JAR library

The [Gephi](http://gephi.org) Toolkit project packages essential Gephi modules (Graph, Layout, Filters, IO…) in a standard Java library which any Java project can use for getting things done. It can be used on a server or command-line tool to do the same things Gephi does but automatically.

## Use the toolkit

Find documentation and examples on the [**Toolkit Portal**](http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Toolkit_portal). It shows examples how to use the toolkit. Find more help on the [forum](http://gephi.org/plugins), the community can help you.

- Add the Gephi repository

        <project>
        ...
           <repositories>
              <repository>
                 <id>gephi-snapshots</id>
                 <name>Gephi Snapshots</name>
                 <url>http://nexus.gephi.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
              </repository>
              <repository>
                 <id>gephi-releases</id>
                 <name>Gephi Releases</name>
                 <url>http://nexus.gephi.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/</url>
              </repository>
              ...
           </repositories>
        ...
        </project>

- Add the dependency

        <project>
        ...
           <dependencies>
              <dependency>
                 <groupId>org.gephi</groupId>
                 <artifactId>gephi-toolkit</artifactId>
                 <version>0.9-SNAPSHOT</version>
              </dependency>
              ...
           </dependencies>
        ...
        </project>

## Build

The Gephi Toolkit is entirely based on Gephi's source code and packages the core modules in a single JAR.

### Requirements

- Java JDK 6 or 7 with preferably [Oracle Java JDK](http://java.com/en/).

- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) version 3.0.3 or later

### Checkout and Build the sources

- Fork the repository and clone

        git clone git@github.com:username/gephi-toolkit.git

- Run the following command or open the project in Netbeans

        mvn clean install

### Can the Toolkit use plugins?

Yes that is possible if the plug-in doesn’t depend on something not included in the Toolkit, for instance the UI. If that happens, it is likely that the plug-in has been divided in several modules, and in that case one need only the core and can exclude the UI.
Consult this [HowTo](http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/How_to_use_Gephi_plug-ins_with_the_Gephi_Toolkit) page to know how to extract the plugin JARs from the NBM file. Once you have the JARs, include them in your project’s classpath, in addition of the Gephi Toolkit.
